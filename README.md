# PERN.Todo - Simple Full-stack Todo App

## Technologies
- PERN Stack - PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node
- React Hook Form for form handling
- React Query for data fetching from database
- MUI for styles

## Purpose
- This will be the first full-stack application that I'm making from scratch.
- My goals for this project are to learn how to build APIs for simple CRUD capabilities and hooking it up to the front-end.
- Learning how to make SQL queries and working with relational database.
- Also getting a better feel for using MUI throughout the app
- I may or may not end up adding authentication later on.
